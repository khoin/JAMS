title: JAMS Development History

This is my first big project in programming after [Pascal Draw](https://github.com/khoin/Pascal-Draw). It's been really fun developing every little thing for an application. From interfaces, context menus, file saving, WAV parsing, DSP to font designing, even! Unfortunately, some of those home-grown things had to go: my file saving couldn't handle big files when saving audio data came around, the 5x6 font was simply too small and limited to one language. Nonetheless, I've had great discussions with friends and had tons of help. I started posting short clips, pictures and videos of my developement since the beginning but I've only consilidated them here since Jul 29, 2017.
